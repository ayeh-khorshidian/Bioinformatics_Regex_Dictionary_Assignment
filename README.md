# Bioinformatics Assignment - Regex and Dictionary Handling

This repository contains solutions to Python programming tasks focused on using regular expressions and dictionaries for bioinformatics applications.

## Task Overview

### Task 1: Regular Expressions I
A program that searches for specific RNA-related terms in a paragraph and prints each term with its ending position.

### Task 2: Regular Expressions II
A function that searches for a user-specified motif in a DNA or protein sequence loaded from a FASTA file.

### Task 3: Dictionaries
A function that reads a file of gene accession numbers and nucleotide sequences, then stores them in a dictionary and displays each pair.

## Usage

1. **Run** `Bioinformatics_Regex_Dictionary_Assignment.py` in a Python environment.
2. Follow prompts to provide input files and motifs.
   - Task 2 requires a FASTA file with a sequence.
   - Task 3 requires a file with gene accession numbers and sequences, separated by commas.
